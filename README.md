# ♻️ Smart Waste Management System

A smart, IoT-enabled waste monitoring and forecasting system designed to improve urban cleanliness by automating waste level detection, optimizing collection routes, and predicting future waste patterns using machine learning.

---

## 📖 Overview

Traditional waste management systems often rely on manual checks and fixed collection schedules, leading to inefficiencies like overflowing bins or unnecessary trips. Our system addresses this by:

- Using ultrasonic sensors and NodeMCU for real-time bin monitoring.
- Displaying fill levels on a web dashboard.
- Applying ML models for waste forecasting.
- Providing route optimization to reduce fuel usage and time.
- Offering a mobile interface for collectors/admins.
